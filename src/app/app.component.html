                <h2>I don't like having my salary publicly available. Will you take it down?</h2>
                <p>
                    No. As an employee of a public entity, your salary is available as part of the public record.
                    Salaries included in the Salary Guide are paid by tuition-paying students and tax dollars.
                    There are no legal grounds for removal, but please contact us if you believe there is a
                    factual error with the published salary.
                </p>

                <h2>Are some salaries not included in the guide?</h2>
                <p>
                    Data included in the non-Gray Book excludes employees or jobs that are classified as extra help,
                    graduate assistant, pre-doctoral fellow, academic or graduate hourly, summer appointment,
                    medical resident, student, retiree or unpaid. It also does not include jobs classified as
                    cell phone stipend, deferred pay, lump sum, one time pay, sabbatical supplement,temporary
                    assignments or vacation payouts.
                </p>

                <h2>How often is the Salary Guide updated?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Salary Guide is updated in the Fall semester each year. Salaries may be affected by events
                    throughout the year, including mid-year promotions or unpaid leaves, and do not include all
                    compensation, such as overtime and benefits. Factors such as experience, education and specialized
                    training can all influence how much employees are paid.
